# RDS Core Project

Welcome to the **RDS Core Project** repository! 👋

## 🌟 About the Project

This is my journey into software development and project building. I'm creating **RDS Core**, an application designed to simplify store-level operations and management. The app aims to provide features like:

- Easy troubleshooting tools for common hardware and software issues.
- A streamlined process for creating support tickets.
- Centralized management for updates and notifications.

Right now, this project is in its **early stages** and very much a work in progress. Every day, I'm learning something new and applying it here!

## 🚀 Goals of This Project

- Build a functional and scalable app for small grocery stores.
- Keep the user experience simple and accessible for non-tech-savvy users.
- Learn and grow my skills in **React**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**.
